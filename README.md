# Optimized Heart Disease Classification Using Genetic Algorithms and Rule-Based Learning

## Overview:

This research explores integrating If-Then rules and Decision Rules with Genetic Algorithms to optimize classification accuracy in heart disease prediction. Traditional machine learning models often rely on pre-defined features and heuristics, but this study aims to evolve and optimize rule-based classifiers for better decision-making.

## Methodology:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

    Extensive data imputation based on domain-specific factors.

    Removal of irrelevant categorical attributes and redundant features.

    Standardization of numerical features for consistency.
    
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Dimensionality Reduction**

    Variance analysis to determine optimal feature reduction.

    Feature selection based on PCA component contributions.

    Visualizing impact through explained variance, scree plots, and scatter plots
